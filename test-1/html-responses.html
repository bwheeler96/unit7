<!-- Problem 1

Explain the statement <script type="text/javascript" src=”scripts/javascript.js”></script>

The script tag indicates to the browser that there is javascript that should be loaded
for the webpage to render work properly. The script is an external script that
will be loaded from the current path (i.e. example.com/current/path/scripts/javascript.js).

If this tag is in the <head> of a document, most browsers will fetch and
run the javascript before the page is rendered, but it is not a guarantee. Older browsers,
or popular browser extensions such as AdBlock may cause the javascript loading to fail.
